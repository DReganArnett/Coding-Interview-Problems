CONSTRAINTS:
   
EXAMPLES GIVEN:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOLVING THE PROBLEM: 

1.  UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM 
    a.  CAN I RESTATE THE PROBLEM?
        
    b.  WHAT ARE THE INPUTS?
        
    c.  WHAT ARE THE OUTPUTS THAT SHOULD COME FROM THE SOLUTION?
       
    d.  DO I HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION?  WHAT QUESTIONS DO I HAVE?
         
    e.  HOW SHOULD I LABEL THE IMPORTANT DATA IN THE PROBLEM?
        
2.  EXPLORE CONCRETE EXAMPLES
       

3.  BREAK THE PROBLEM DOWN STEP-BY-STEP
    a.  Can I eliminate the circumstances where the output would automatically be false? 
        Alternatively, what would need to be true or false in order for the output to be correct? 
       
    b. Create a step-by-step plan to solve the problem.

4.  IMPLEMENT THE STEPS ABOVE, AND MAKE USE OF DEVTOOLS IF NECESSARY



// TEST CASES: 

<!-- console.log('TEST CASE 1:')

console.log('nums: ', nums)
solution = 
console.log('solution: ', solution)
output = singleNumber(nums);
console.log('output: ', output)
if (solution === output) {
    console.log('PASS')
} else {
    console.log('FAIL');
}
console.log(''); -->

5.  IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE, SOLVE A SIMPLER PROBLEM
    a. Identify the part of the problem where you are stuck
    
    b. Ignore that part and solve everything else

    c. Return to the part where you are stuck and try to figure it out.

6. LOOK BACK AND REFACTOR
    a. What is the time/space complexity for your solution?

    b. Are there parts of the solution that could be more efficient?

    c. Are there parts of the solution that could be shorter?

    d. Consider other approaches to the problem.  Are any of them more efficient? -->
